Django Todo App in Docker
=========================

This is based on an example project and instructions found for PyCharm and adapted to work with IntelliJ.  
You can find the [original blog post here] (http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2017/08/using-docker-compose-on-windows-in-pycharm).

The steps outlined below enable the user to set up the project, configure IntelliJ to use Docker, remote Python interpreter 
and trip breakpoints in the Django code enabling step-by-step debugging of the code running in a container. 
Additionally, this example removes any requirement to install Postgres, Python, python modules on the local system.  
These dependencies are all encapsulated within containers.
